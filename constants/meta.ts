export const aboutDoctor = `I embarked on an extraordinary journey of education and experience, beginning in 1988 when I enrolled in the Indian Air Force (IAF) as a paramedic combatant member. I excelled in my ground service training, receiving the prestigious award for physical fitness. In 1999, I successfully completed a certified physiotherapy course, further enhancing my skills within the IAF. Continuing my dedication to professional growth, I accomplished my Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) in 2003, earning distinction for my outstanding performance.

In 2007, I proudly graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Physical Therapy (BPT), solidifying my knowledge and expertise in the field. As a testament to my commitment to excellence, I became a member of the International Association of Clinical Physiotherapists (IACP) in 2010.

To expand my horizons and gain comprehensive experience, I had the privilege of serving as the in-charge of training for physiotherapy courses conducted within the IAF from 2004 to 2008. During this time, I had the opportunity to work closely with Asha School of Special Education, where I gained invaluable firsthand experience in handling a diverse range of electrotherapy equipment. Specifically, I specialized in rehabilitating wounded casualties, enabling them to regain their physical capabilities following curative surgeries.

Overall, my journey has been defined by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, consistently striving to improve and contribute to the field of physiotherapy.`;
